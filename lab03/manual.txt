1. Summary
1) object : get gene region using HMM
2) author : Soojeong Shim (2016025532)
3) submit : 2018.11.18
4) environment : Mac OS & python3.6

2. Program File
1) test.py
(1) input : model parameter estimated, DNA sequence for testing
(2) Predict gene using Viterbi algorithm including backtracking procedure
(3) Outputs the prediction result(result.txt)
2) train.py
(1) input : gene region file, intergenic region file
(2) Give them predifined emission probability for some states such as start and stop
(3) Outputs model parameters in a file, which will be used for gene prediction

3. Usage
1) test.py
 - python3 test.py [gene test file] [model file name]
* This program has argument including gene test file, model file name.
* Gene test file is necessary, but if model file name is not given, this program set model file name as "model.txt" automatically
2) train.py
 - python3 train.py [gene training file] [intergenic training file]
* This program has argument including gene training file, intergenic training file
* Gene training file, intergenic training file name is necessary
* Model file name is set as "model.txt" automatically

4. Input & Output File
1) test.py
(1) input file
 - model file
   - generated by train.py
   - reference 4-2)-(2) model
   - this contained only emission probability
 - gene test file
   - used to test learned model parameter
   - first line is only sequence name
   - second line is sequence line
(2) output file
 - result.txt
   - line is consist of gene order, start index, end index ([gene] [order] : [start index] [end index])
2) train.py
(1) input file
 - gene training file
   - gene region
   - used for getting gene emission probability
   - all content is paired sequence name, gene region sequence over two line
 - intergenic training file
   - intergenic region
   - used for getting intergenic emission probability
   - all content is paired sequence name, inter genic region sequence over two line
(2) output file
 - model file
   - all content is paired state name, emission probability over two line
   - emission probability is ordered A, C, G, T

5. Other
1) This program spend about 2 minutes many as much. Please wait until program exit itself.
2) If there are characters except A, C, G, T in training data, this program change it as C-gene character-.
